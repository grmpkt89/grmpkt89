- 👋 Hi, I’m @grmpkt89 
- 👀 I’m interested in dogs, reading about new things, lifting weights and the bible
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code from the beginning 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to help strengthen cybersecurity and stay within the aviation field
- 📫 Reach me @ cornejoc0711@gmail.com
- I am a veteran transitioning from aircraft maintenance and looking to break into tech, I have always loved computers but my primary concern has been what was in front of me for the last 13 years.
I am learning so much about life that I have this hunger to delve my teeth into anything. Working in the aviation industry since I was 17 makes it hard to deviate from the tunnel vision I've put myself under. I have recently started classes again hoping to re-create that inspiration I once had when I was a kid!
